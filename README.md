# Energy-Consumption-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
machine-learning model to predict the energy
consumption of a steel factory based on various features of the properties.
i attempted to build a regression model that can accurately predict the energy
consumption of a steel factory given its features. i started  by preprocessing the data
by handling missing values, scaling the features , and splitting it into training
and test sets.
Next, i implemented and trained a regression algorithm such as Linear Regression,
Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, or Elastic Net Regression.
then i evaluated the performance of my model using metrics such as Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared score on the test set.
Finally, i selected the best-performing model and fine-tuned its hyperparameters
using techniques such as Grid Search and Random Search. then evaluated the
final model on the test set .
